Duel Monsters Online, oldschool style Yu-Gi-Oh! in Unity

Quick preview of the game:

My goal is to make a great open source Yu-Gi-Oh! game engine, because I believe the modern official games are completely ruined with powercreep and microtransactions caused by commercial pressure.
This is open source to encourage anyone to make their own version of the game using my engine, because I want good Yu-Gi-Oh! games to exist.
I plan to make a single player story-based RPG with a MMORPG Online mode, but feel free to use my engine to make anything you want. Goes without saying that I don't own the copyrights to the cards nor the game, so you can't monetize anything related to this repository.

By the way, I'm working alone so any help is appreciated!
