Duel Monsters Online, oldschool style Yu-Gi-Oh! in Unity. Quick preview of the game: https://julianlerej.com/DM

My goal is to make a great open source ygo engine, because I believe the modern official games and TCG are completely ruined with powercreep and microtransactions caused by commercial pressure. I work on this whenever I have time, as a hobby and to train my programming skills.

This is open source to encourage anyone to make their own version of the game using my engine, simply because I want good ygo games to exist.
I plan to make a single player story-based RPG with a side MMO mode, but feel free to use my engine to make anything you want. Goes without saying that I don't own the copyrights to the trading card game nor anything related to the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise including the anime series, characters, cards, game rules, art, audio, etc, so you can't monetize anything related to this repository.

By the way, I'm working alone so any help is appreciated. Thanks for reading!
