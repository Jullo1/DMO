Story Mode
-The story is mix of Forbidden Memories and the anime.
-Unlocks characters on Free Play as you beat them, similar to FM. The stronger the character the better the rewards for beating them in Free Play.
-Depending on the part of the story you are, you switch your current character and get that character's bonus cards (for example Dark Magician, Gaia, etc, when playing as Yugi in Modern Times)
-The idea is to increase your deck strength outside story mode, then advance in the story as you are able to beat higher level duelists.

Chapter 1: Ancient Egypt
Using Anciet Rules (no tributes required, fusion/ritual monsters can't attack the same turn they are summoned)
-Playing character: Prince (no bonus cards)
--Simon + Tutorial (lv 0)
The prince gets bored of dueling servants and goes to the town's cardshop to find better opponents
--Tea (past) (lv 1) (unlocked as modern version of tea in free duel)
--Joey (past) (lv 1) (not unlocked in free duel yet)
Back to the palace, Heishin invades, he claims he has betrayed the king and is taking over
--Heishin (forced loss) (lv 8) (not unlocked in free duel yet)
After losing, Simon gives you the Millenium Puzzle. He explains it was owned by the king, so you can become now the legitimate owner (got the ownership after losing the duel, so its not transfered to Heishin). He also explains Heishin must not be allowed to have it's powers, so you shatter it.
Shattering the Millenium Puzzle traps the soul of the prince inside it. He must now wait for someone to solve the puzzle to release him.

Chapter 2: Modern Times
A lot of time passed, Yugi solved the Millenium Puzzle and inherited it's powers. Now playing casual duels at school.
-Playing character: Yugi (no bonus cards)
--Tristan (lv 1)
--Joey (lv 2) (not unlocked in free duel yet)
--Bakura (lv 3)
Kaiba goes to Yugi's grandpa's shop and sees he has a Blue-Eyes White Dragon. He challenges grandpa, wins, takes the card and breaks it. Grandpa asks Yugi to use his deck to teach Kaiba the heart of the cards.
Yugi changes to Yami and challenges Kaiba to a duel.
-Playing character: Yami Yugi (obtained grandpa's deck: Dark Magician, Gaia, Curse of Dragon, Exodia, etc)
--Kaiba (lv 10, scripted duel, you can lose, but you can only win with exodia because his deck is way better than yours) (not unlocked in free duel yet)

Chapter 3: Kaiba Corp Tournament
With the recent increase of talented duelists, Kaiba announced the Kaiba Corp Tournament to declare the next King of Games.
Kaiba also introduces the Advanced Rules, which includes tribute summon and fusion/ritual monsters are free to attack on the first turn they are summoned.
From now on, the game uses Advanced Rules. Ancient Rules can be selected in Free Play.
Yugi feels the Millenium Puzzle telling him to enter the tournament, not sure why. He wanted to particiapte for fun anyways. Joey follows.
In the way to the tournament Weebil throws the exodia cards away.

--Mako (lv 4)

Shadi interrupts and says he needs to test Yugi in a duel
--Shadi (lv 5) (outside tournament)
Shadi reveals Yami's identity, now Yugi can talk to Yami.
Yami says his memory isnt clear but he knows he needs to go back to his time, and for that Shadi explains they need to collect all 7 millenium items.
Shadi says he kept guard of the millenium items as a tomb keeper and he already has 2 of them (Millenium Scale and Millenium Key), they belong to Yugi now since he just beat him in a duel. But he gave away the rest of the items before as they reacted to certain people, and he claims all of them are in the tournament, that's why the Millenium Puzzle told Yugi to enter.
Shadi claims he also possess a 3rd item, the Millenium Rod, but he says the rod seems to be calling to Kaiba, even though Kaiba refused to take the item, so he must be defeated in a duel for Yugi to claim ownership of the item.
Yugi also has the Millenium Puzzle, so 4 more millenium items must claimed. Ishisu, also a tomb keeper, challenges Yugi to a duel as well.
--Ishisu (lv 6) (outside tournament, also wants to test Yugi to see if he is worthy of the items, Millenium Necklace obtained)

Chapter 5: Tournament Finals
These are supposed to be match duels due to tournament finals' rules (except for the final match which is 1 duel), but you must win 2 in a row or else it's game over since you lose the millenium items when losing a duel. The first 2 duelists wants the millenium items, Kaiba is not interested but he must be defeated or else you lose the chance to claim the Millenium Rod.
--Bakura (lv 3, 8) (quarter finals, 2 duels, changes to Yami Bakura after beating Bakura (uses the same weak deck than in chapter 1), then Yami Bakura unlocked in free mode, he has the Millenium Ring)
--Pegasus (lv 6, 9) (semi finals, 2 duels, uses toon deck first, then changes to Relinquished version on second duel, Relinquished version unlocked in Free Duel (the toon version uses unobtainable cards), he has the Millenium Eye)
--Kaiba (lv 10)  (final match, 1 duel, beat him to claim ownership of the Millenium Rod) (same deck as before, now he is unlocked in free duel)

Chapter 6: Back to Ancient Egypt
After the tournament ends, Shadi says he will go retrieve the remaining items (Ring and Eye) now that they belong to Yugi and take them all with the Millenium Key, Scales, Necklace and Rod (which he is carrying) to the ritual place. Then he explains that in order to release Yami's soul, he must place the final item, the Millenium Puzzle, and then Yami must be defeated in a duel. Gives Yugi time to prepare for the final duel.
Shadi teleports Yugi and friends to the Pharaoh's Tomb, Yami is sepparated from Yugi. Yugi claims he is the only one who can beat him because he knows him the best.
Playing character: Yugi (no bonus cards, Dark Magician, Gaia, etc, given to Yami, must use all the cards collected by the player)
--Yami (lv 10)
Now that Yami/the prince is back to his time, he must stop Heishin from taking over the kingdom. Heishin was looking for the Millenium Puzzle that was sealed with the prince, so they allow him to see him.
-Playing character: Prince (no bonus cards as well) (Ancient Rules are back, so no tribute summons, and must wait a turn to attack with fusion/ritual monsters)
--Heishin (lv 8, same deck as before, now he is unlocked in free duel)
Heishin who had 6 millenium items is defeated, so now the prince owns all 7. It was surprisingly easy, something is wrong.
Seto appears (Kaiba's past version) and says he was waiting for someone to collect all the items, to save him the trouble of looking for all of them himself. He was confident he could defeat Heishin or whoever defeats him. He explains that he actually owns the Millenium Rod, not Heishin, and he was planning to betray him when he thought he had all 7.
--Seto (lv 12) (uses an upgraded version of Kaiba's deck)
Heishin demands that all items are given to him or else he kills Seto. The prince has sympathized with Seto as his rival during the duel and wants to save him, so he gives the items to Heishin. All 7 items are placed, the ritual is complete despite the prince still owning the items.
Nitemare appears. He refuses to listen to Heishin since he has no millenium items (the prince is still the owner of the items since he didn't lose a duel for them, so Heishin can't use the items' powers to defy Nitemare). Nitemare seals Heishin away, then claims he created the cards and the millenium items so he is op af.
Seto manages to save the Millenium Puzzle and gives it to the prince as gratitude for saving him. He tells the prince to try to stop Nitemare, he is the only one who can do it. The prince is still the legitimate owner of the Millenium Puzzle because he didn't lose a duel despite giving the item away, so he can use its power to confront Nitemare.
Nitemate accept his challenge. He says that if the prince manages to beat him, he will go back to the shadows (and he is forced to keep his word because of the power of the millenium items), but if Nitemare wins, he will claim the millenium items so that no one can defy him again and do whatever he wants.
--Nitemare (lv 12, lv 14) (2 duels, after losing the first, he challenges the player again, lv12 is the max possible duelist level, but the second version has ancient cards, which are special unobtainable cards, the first version is unlocked in free duel, the second version only serves as a challenge for the Story Mode final duel)
Nitemare loses, he is sealed forever, Seto admits his defeat and disappears. After recovering the kingdom, the prince now becomes the king, people call him the undefeated "King of Games". Credits roll.
